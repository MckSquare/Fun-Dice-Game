# Fun-Dice-Game
(This game is one of my early creations, and found in archives after a long time :D It's really fun when you see your archives and find out this kind of things there. Appreciate it if you created like this in early days!)

# Download iff you've python installed :p
This is just a fun game, and one of my early creations.
Please download dice2 if you've python 2 installed (This code is not tested, will appreciate if you got any correction)
dice.py is only for python 3 users.

To use it, best way: open cmd in the download folder, run python dice.py (or python dice2.py #for python 2 users)

Arigato!
