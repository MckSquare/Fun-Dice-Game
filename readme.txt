Download iff you've python installed :p
this is just a fun game, and one of my early creations.
please download dice2 if you've python 2 installed (This code is not tested, will appreciate if you got any correction)
dice.py is only for python 3 users.

to use it, best way: open cmd in the download folder, run python dice.py (or python dice2.py #for python 2 users)

Thank you!
